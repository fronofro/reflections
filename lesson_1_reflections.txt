How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Showed snippets of code in similar lines where there were differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Remember what worked in case new functionality breaks old functionality.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You know the contents of each commit, making it easier to know which one to 
    go back to. Needing to rememebr and regularly commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple

    Code has interdependencies on other files so it needs them all to execute

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    See the different commits and see the difference between files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always go back to a safe save, and I can find where the origin of bugs are

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    everything
